# BINARY-CLASSIFICATION-OF-CNN-CUSTOM-MODEL-DEVELOPMENT-FOR-AFRICAN-AND-ASIAN-ELEPHANT-DATASET
This is a custom CNN model to classify images whether it is African or Asian elephant. While the output is the accuracy, the main objective of this project is not to get a high accuracy but rather to learn how to use convolution neural network (CNN) for classification using tensorflow.
