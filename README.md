# BINARY CLASSIFICATION OF CNN CUSTOM MODEL DEVELOPMENT FOR AFRICAN AND ASIAN ELEPHANT DATASET:
This is a custom CNN model to classify images whether it is African or Asian elephant. While the output is the accuracy, the main objective of this project is not to get a high accuracy but rather to learn how to use convolution neural network (CNN) for classification using tensorflow.


## DESCRIPTION

In this model development African and Asian elephant dataset is used, through  convolutional neural network(CNN)
we predicted either image is African and Asian elephants .

Since we use tensorflow framework so brief introduction about tensorflow.

TENSORFLOW:

TensorFlow is an open-source software library for deep learning and machine learning developed by Google Brain Team. It is used for a wide range of applications, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and computer vision. It is also used to create and train neural networks, which are the backbone of deep learning.


As we collect African and Asian elephant dataset for model development ,using Tensorflow module 'ImageDataGenerator' we rescale image size to train the model. After that we built an architecture using tensorflow includes Kernel layers,maxpooling layers of CNN and followed by hidden layers of ANN.
